A 'FarceWare" Production

www.chextrek.xv15mods.com

------------
Description:
------------

It's been a few months since the release of Alpha 0.1, but the updates and changes are sure to be worth the wait.

Based on an old TC for the original DOOM called 'Chex Quest', the developers aimed to create a "run 'n gun fps" that even the tiniest of tots could play. It was released for free in specially marked packages for in in Chex brand cereal. Now ten years later it's getting a story re-telling.

Keeping true to the original, there is no killing whatsoever. In fact there's not even any blood. The enemies are slime based, cereal eating aliens, called Flemoids that are from the 'Milk Dimension' with a nasty habit of sliming you to the floor. Possibly led by an inside traitor, the Flemoids get access to the most secure places to create havoc. You are sent to investigate. Try not to get stuck!


-----------------------------
New Features since Alpha 0.1:
-----------------------------

To open doors, press 'E'. To set it to whatever key you want, open the 'DoomConfig.cfg' file in any text editor (ie. Notepad) and change the bind for "_impulse16". By default the text string reads ~~ bind "e" "_impulse16" ~~ Chnage the "e" to whatever key you would like it to be.

Installation:
-------------

Just extract this zip file straight into your Doom 3 folder. There should be a folder called 'chex' inside the doom 3 folder. (ie. C:\Doom 3\chex)
To run the game, open Doom 3 and click the MODs tab. Load "Chex Trek: Beyond the Quest ~BETA 0.5"

Windows:
To make a shortcut to Chex Trek, make a shortcut for Doom 3 and go into the properties and add '+set fs_game chex' at the end of the Target text string.
(ie. the whole text string should look something like ~~ "C:\Doom 3\DOOM3.exe" +set fs_game chex ~~)
