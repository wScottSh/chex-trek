TODO: someday by someone
------------------------
-CDA
--STATS
4:39:59 PM: I'd like to have the health and armor up there. A picture of the chex guys head that changes with amount of damage, like the classic doom hud.
4:40:26 PM: and a picture*
--Objectives
---some kinda link with the map would be cool

HudMap
-AMAP pickup needs to show the map
-Hud map defaults to open
-make hud map icons smaller
-zoom for hud map

-Intro map (various notes from bhenderson)
the chex hq sits upon a spoon high over the clouds
yeah, I was thinking there could be an elevator that goes up the shaft of the spoon
and the top floor of chexhq would be the director's office
he player doesn't gain control until after the elevator hits the top
so that I could put some kind of gag in about waiting in an elevator with cheesy elevator music

-Generate DDS files ie someday (dds that replace D3 ones NEED to be created)
-Lightcarve sf_923
-LINUX & MACOS_X builds (before release)
-idTarget_EndLevelGUI
--I think if you have full ammo/health items should be considered 100%
-inventory items are saved between maps, need to remove items at EOL
--remove item entity maybe?
--ex: keys
-thought I fixed the percent crap but I saw a percent w/ fists
-trails
--draw everywhere (not exactly effecient)

Everything else

8/20/06
-------



6/15/06
-------
Ok i've changed a bunch of stuff so I'm gonna try and list it before I forget
-i thought the trails lasted forever, but it looks like it's back at 5secs, wtf
-bunch of shit in SDK, mostly the map
-modded the pda model & def?

3/25/06
-replaced loading screens and updated dds
-replaced hangar_right/left and updated dds


2/14/06
-------
SVN server HD died so took the oppurtunity to restart
the repository

1/3/06
------
SDK ramblings:
trails are are "watched" by gameLocal
trails could be extended to general renderent class pretty easily
idActor has a pointer to the trail if it has one to fade at remove
**A check w/ gameLocal for the trail would be a good idea

Footprint stuff now checks material being stuff on w/ renderworld
trace.  Added offset keys for trace. footprint_s_z footprint_e_z

idTarget_EndLevelGUI is now more or less a general purpose GUI w/
some overhead (level stats stuff)
**there are new keys/commands but i dont remember 'em (sf's end
  has good examples)

spawnDict added to script system, allows spawning dicts by name,
stuff set by setSpawnArg overrides defaults
